    "Acme Studios, a major Hollywood production company, maintains a vast movie database. This database tracks information about movies they've produced, including titles, directors, and taglines, and is constantly striving to improve the movie-going experience for its audience. One way to achieve this is by understanding which movies resonate most with viewers. While raw vote averages can be informative, they don't necessarily account for the number of votes received. A movie with a high average rating based on a small number of votes may not be as representative of audience sentiment as a movie with a slightly lower average rating but a significantly higher number of votes. This information will help Acme Studios identify movies that are not only highly rated but also generate significant audience engagement, potentially influencing future marketing efforts and content creation strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem Statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this, Acme Studios wants to calculate a \"weighted average rating\" that considers both the average rating (vote_average) and the number of votes received (vote_count) for each movie in their database. This will provide a more nuanced understanding of audience reception.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula provided takes into account the number of votes a movie has received (\"v\") relative to a minimum threshold (\"m\") set at 104 votes. It also factors in the movie's average rating (\"R\") and the overall average vote rating across the entire dataset (\"C\") set at 5.97.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formula: (v/(v+m) * R) + (m/(m+v) * C )\n",
    "Write an SQL query to create a new column named \"Weighted_avg_rating\" based on this formula. Then, we'll retrieve the top 10 movies with the highest weighted average ratings, displaying the movie title (\"original_title\") and the weighted average rating\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Result:\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the columns original_title, Weighted_avg_rating\n",
    "Return the output ordered by Weighted_avg_rating in descending order and original_title in ascending order.\n",
